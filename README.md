# MedNest Landing Page

Welcome to the **MedNest** landing page project — a modern, responsive healthcare website layout designed using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

---

## 🧠 Purpose

This project is part of my **weekly full-stack web development learning challenge**. I aim to publish one mini-project each week on GitHub to deepen my frontend and backend skills after a long break.  

> 📌 **Note**: This week’s upload came with a bit of a delay due to a steep learning curve involving responsive layout adjustments and custom styling.

## 🎯 Inspiration

The design was inspired by the elegant and professional layout of [Healthvest by Colorlib](https://preview.colorlib.com/theme/healthvest/#), which served as a great learning reference for:

- Grid-based responsive design  
- Clean UI with Bootstrap 5  
- User-centric healthcare content structuring
